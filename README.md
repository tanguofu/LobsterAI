**LobsterAI** is an all-in-one personal assistant Agent developed by [NetEase Youdao](https://www.youdao.com/). It works around the clock to handle your everyday tasks — data analysis, making presentations, generating videos, writing documents, searching the web, sending emails, scheduling tasks, and more.

At its core is **Cowork mode** — it executes tools, manipulates files, and runs commands in a local or sandboxed environment, all under your supervision. You can also chat with agent via Telegram, Discord, DingTalk or Feishu (Lark) and get work done from your phone anytime, anywhere.

## Key Features

- **All-in-One Productivity Assistant** — Data analysis, PPT creation, video generation, document writing, web search, email — covers the full range of daily work
- **Local + Sandbox Execution** — Run tasks directly on your machine or in an isolated Alpine Linux sandbox
- **Built-in Skills** — Office document generation, web search, Playwright automation, Remotion video generation, and more
- **Scheduled Tasks** — Create recurring tasks via conversation or the GUI — daily news digests, inbox cleanup, periodic report generation, and more
- **Persistent Memory** — Automatically extracts user preferences and personal facts from conversations, remembers your habits across sessions, and gets smarter the more you use it
- **Mobile via IM** — Control your Agent remotely from your phone through Telegram, Discord, DingTalk, or Feishu
- **Permission Gating** — All tool invocations require explicit user approval before execution
- **Cross-Platform** — macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Windows, Linux desktop, plus mobile coverage via IM
- **Local Data** — SQLite storage keeps your chat history and configuration on your device

</p>

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24 < 25
- **npm**

### Install & Develop

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netease-youdao/LobsterAI.git
cd lobsterai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development (Vite dev server + Electron with hot reload)
npm run electron:dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:5175` by default.

### Production Build

```bash
# TypeScript compilation + Vite bundle
npm run build

# ESLint check
npm run lint
```

## Packaging & Distribution

Uses [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to produce platform-specific installers. Output goes to `release/`.

```bash
# macOS (.dmg)
npm run dist:mac

# macOS - Intel only
npm run dist:mac:x64

# macOS - Apple Silicon only
npm run dist:mac:arm64

# macOS - Universal (both architectures)
npm run dist:mac:universal

# Windows (.exe NSIS installer)
npm run dist:win

# Linux (.AppImage)
npm run dist:linux
```

## Architecture

LobsterAI uses Electron's strict process isolation. All cross-process communication goes through IPC.

### Process Model

**Main Process** (`src/main/main.ts`):
- Window lifecycle management
- SQLite persistence
- CoworkRunner — Claude Agent SDK execution engine
- IM Gateways — DingTalk, Feishu, Telegram, Discord remote access
- 40+ IPC channel handlers
- Security: context isolation enabled, node integration disabled, sandbox enabled

**Preload Script** (`src/main/preload.ts`):
- Exposes `window.electron` API via `contextBridge`
- Includes `cowork` namespace for session management and stream events

**Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/`):
- React 18 + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS
- All UI and business logic
- Communicates with main process exclusively through IPC

## Cowork System

Cowork is the core feature of LobsterAI — an AI working session system built on the Claude Agent SDK. Designed for productivity scenarios, it can autonomously complete complex tasks like data analysis, document generation, and information retrieval.

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` | Automatically selects based on context |
| `local` | Direct local execution, full speed |
| `sandbox` | Isolated Alpine Linux VM, safety first |

### Stream Events

Cowork uses IPC events for real-time bidirectional communication:

- `message` — New message added to the session
- `messageUpdate` — Incremental streaming content update
- `permissionRequest` — Tool execution requires user approval
- `complete` — Session execution finished
- `error` — Execution error occurred

### Permission Control

All tool invocations involving file system access, terminal commands, or network requests require explicit user approval in the `CoworkPermissionModal`. Both single-use and session-level approvals are supported.

## Skills System

LobsterAI ships with 16 built-in skills covering productivity, creative, and automation scenarios, configured via `SKILLs/skills.config.json`:

| Skill | Function | Typical Use Case |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| web-search | Web search | Information retrieval, research |
| docx | Word document generation | Reports, proposals |
| xlsx | Excel spreadsheet generation | Data analysis, dashboards |
| pptx | PowerPoint creation | Presentations, business reviews |
| pdf | PDF processing | Document parsing, format conversion |
| remotion | Video generation (Remotion) | Promo videos, data visualization animations |
| playwright | Web automation | Browser tasks, automated testing |
| canvas-design | Canvas drawing and design | Posters, chart design |
| frontend-design | Frontend UI design | Prototyping, page design |
| develop-web-game | Web game development | Quick game prototypes |
| scheduled-task | Scheduled tasks | Periodic automated workflows |
| weather | Weather queries | Weather information |
| local-tools | Local system tools | File management, system operations |
| create-plan | Plan authoring | Project planning, task breakdown |
| skill-creator | Custom skill creation | Extend new capabilities |
| imap-smtp-email | Email send/receive | Email processing, auto-replies |

Custom skills can be created via `skill-creator` and hot-loaded at runtime.

## Scheduled Tasks

LobsterAI supports scheduled tasks that let the Agent automatically execute recurring work on a set schedule.

### How to Create

- **Conversational** — Tell the Agent in natural language (e.g., "collect tech news for me every morning at 9 AM"), and it will create the scheduled task automatically
- **GUI** — Add tasks manually in the Scheduled Tasks management panel with a visual interface for configuring timing and task content

### Typical Scenarios

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| News Collection | Automatically gather industry news and generate a summary every morning |
| Inbox Cleanup | Periodically check your inbox, categorize emails, and summarize important ones |
| Data Reports | Generate a weekly business data analysis report |
| Content Monitoring | Regularly check specific websites for changes and send notifications |
| Work Reminders | Generate to-do lists or meeting notes on a schedule |

Scheduled tasks are powered by Cron expressions, supporting minute, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals. When a task fires, it automatically starts a Cowork session. Results can be viewed on the desktop or pushed to your phone via IM.

## IM Integration — Mobile Remote Control

LobsterAI can bridge the Agent to multiple IM platforms. Send a message from your phone via IM to remotely trigger the desktop Agent — command your personal assistant anytime, anywhere.

| Platform | Protocol | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| DingTalk | DingTalk Stream | Enterprise bot with bidirectional communication |
| Feishu (Lark) | Lark SDK | Feishu app bot |
| Telegram | grammY | Bot API integration |
| Discord | discord.js | Discord bot integration |
| 企业微信 (WeCom) | 群机器人 + WecomGateway 中继 | 需单独部署 [wecom-gateway](wecom-gateway/README.md)；校验、解密与回复均在 LobsterAI 内完成，中继仅转发。消息交互顺序见 [wecom-gateway 说明](wecom-gateway/README.md#lobsterai-企业微信消息交互顺序) |

Configure the corresponding platform Token/Secret in the Settings panel to enable. Once set up, you can send instructions directly to the Agent from your phone IM (e.g., "analyze this dataset", "make a weekly summary PPT"), and the Agent will execute on the desktop and return results.

## Persistent Memory

LobsterAI has a built-in memory system that remembers your personal information and preferences across sessions, making the Agent more helpful the more you use it.

### How Memories Are Captured

- **Automatic Extraction** — During conversations, the system automatically identifies and stores your personal details (name, occupation), preferences (language, format, style), and personal facts (pets, tools you use) — no manual effort required
- **Explicit Requests** — Tell the Agent directly, e.g., "remember that I prefer Markdown format" or "note down that my project is called LobsterAI," and it will store the memory with higher confidence
- **Manual Management** — Add, edit, or delete memory entries in the Memory management panel within Settings

### How It Works

After each conversation turn, the memory extractor analyzes the dialogue:

| Extraction Type | Example | Confidence |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| Personal Profile | "My name is Alex", "I'm a product manager" | High |
| Personal Ownership | "I have a cat", "I use a MacBook" | High |
| Personal Preferences | "I like a concise style", "I prefer English replies" | Medium-High |
| Assistant Preferences | "Don't use emojis in replies", "Write code in TypeScript" | Medium-High |
| Explicit Requests | "Remember this", "Please note that down" | Highest |

Extracted memories are automatically deduplicated and merged, then injected into the Agent's context in subsequent sessions — making responses more personalized and aligned with your needs.

### Memory Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Memory Toggle | Enable or disable the memory feature | On |
| Auto Capture | Whether to automatically extract memories from conversations | On |
| Capture Strictness | Strict / Standard / Relaxed — controls auto-extraction sensitivity | Standard |
| Max Injected Items | Maximum number of memories injected per session (1–60) | 12 |

## Data Storage

All data is stored in a local SQLite database (`lobsterai.sqlite` in the user data directory).

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `kv` | App configuration key-value pairs |
| `cowork_config` | Cowork settings (working directory, system prompt, execution mode) |
| `cowork_sessions` | Session metadata |
| `cowork_messages` | Message history |
| `scheduled_tasks` | Scheduled task definitions |

## Security Model

LobsterAI enforces security at multiple layers:

- **Process Isolation** — Context isolation enabled, node integration disabled
- **Permission Gating** — Tool invocations require explicit user approval
- **Sandbox Execution** — Optional Alpine Linux VM for isolated execution
- **Content Security** — HTML sandbox, DOMPurify, Mermaid strict mode
- **Workspace Boundaries** — File operations restricted to the designated working directory
- **IPC Validation** — All cross-process calls are type-checked

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Electron 40 |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 |
| State | Redux Toolkit |
| AI Engine | Claude Agent SDK (Anthropic) |
| Storage | sql.js |
| Markdown | react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-katex |
| Diagrams | Mermaid |
| Security | DOMPurify |
| IM | dingtalk-stream · @larksuiteoapi/node-sdk · grammY · discord.js |

## Configuration

### App Configuration

App-level config is stored in the SQLite `kv` table, editable through the Settings panel.

### Cowork Configuration

Cowork session config includes:

- **Working Directory** — Root directory for Agent operations
- **System Prompt** — Customize Agent behavior
- **Execution Mode** — `auto` / `local` / `sandbox`

### Internationalization

Currently English and Chinese are supported. Switch languages in the Settings panel.

## Development Guidelines

- TypeScript strict mode, functional components + Hooks
- 2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons
- Components: `PascalCase`; functions/variables: `camelCase`; Redux slices: `*Slice.ts`
- Tailwind CSS preferred; avoid custom CSS
- Commit messages follow `type: short imperative summary` (e.g., `feat: add artifact toolbar`)
